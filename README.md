# Night Mode

(This is still a work in progress)

A theme made with the general goal of having a slightly less busy look and feel (and partially just to make some features look more like AM). Also includes a few minor tweaks, mainly changes to immersive fullscreen mode. Most changes are easily configurable and/or toggleable to user's choosing via variables in config file.
