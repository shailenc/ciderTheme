# Night Mode

A theme made with the general goal of having a slightly less busy look and feel (and partially just to make some features look more like AM). Also includes a few minor tweaks -- mainly changes to immersive fullscreen mode, but also some others like subtle hover effects as well as a few other changes thrown in for fun. Most changes are easily configurable and/or toggleable to user's choosing via variables in `config.less`.

## Previews

#### More Previews (Fullscreen Mode)

If on the 'now playing' tab, it will blur and lower the brightness of the screen when the cursor isn't on the app. I personally find it nice to throw on a second monitor any time not using it. (This can be disabled by changing `@defocus-fullscreen-off-hover` to `false` in the config file.)

>(This theme is still a work in progress)
